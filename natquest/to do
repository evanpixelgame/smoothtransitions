add little subtexts saying what each of the icons is above or below the icons, also add scrollover propertiers?

start off every scene with attempt to launch it in fullscreen mode (and possibly also landscape perspective),
especially start Open World scene in fullscreen mode, have the option to turn off auto fullscreen mode in settings

have option to switch between joystick and d-pad, possibly switch off diagonal movement see how stardew does it

consolidate all of the preload stuff into the preload scene (maybe except the sprite since that can wait after character selection so
  unceessary extra ones arent added

also spruce up the preload page so it looks more presentable since the preload time will only get longer

fix the opening scenes so that the configuration is all right on them and they all appear nicely in screen

fix the animation so that theres no animation if theyre not moving, or switch in idle or stop animation, also fix something with how it goes diagonal, should i make it so that for movement you can
only for in up down left or right or should i leave diagonal as an option but just slow down the speed and add some animation? see how other games handle it, recheck out stardew

in open world, try and separate out the animation logic into a separate scene like with mobile controls that then gets launched in open world

maybe also maybe a desktop UI scene where all the desktop versions of controls, inventory, other on screen interactable information goes

figure out how to add collision barriers

figure out how to do scene transitions

maybe start off the sprite in a very small map of a cabin or something, then have them move to the open world map

set up all the collision events

 figure out how to set up layers so that it looks nice like it should
