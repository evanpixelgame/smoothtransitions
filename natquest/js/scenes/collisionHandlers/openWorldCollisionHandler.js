//Creates collision objects, sensor objects, and covers handling of the sensor object interactions with player
//Import as needed into scenes that have 2.5D maps that require collision/sensor object creation and handling
//Make sure that all imported maps have their Object layer that deals with collisions is named "Collision Layer 1"
//Also ensure their Object layer that deals with sensors is named "Sensor Layer 1" and when adding custom properties in Tiled editor, do "customID" for property and then give it a value of whatever label will coorelate with its caused effect 
//^^^move this to the mapsetter instructions, also make mapsetter changes described in third comment block

// TRY TO ADD A IF LOGIC TO IT SO THAT IT CAN USE OBJECT PROPERTIES TO DETERMINE WHETHER TO HANDLE THE SENSOR AS ON COLLISION OR OVERLAP
//expirment with different ways to initiate the callback other than collisionStart and overlap, learn how to use overlap better
//maybe split up the sensor handling if the switch cases start to get excessive, maybe each scene can get their own sensorhandler if it starts getting excession
//^^and then this file could just for senor and collision object creation, and then each scene would get its own collision handler function.
//^^maybe keep the main logic for the sensor handling here and then have the individual sensorhandler file for each scene just handle the different switch cases

//in the setter, add another property called overlapSensor and set that to true based on a similar customID principle used to set the customIDs
//or maybe assign contact sensors a customID property that says that and overlap sensors a customID with overlap and set isOverlap from false to true
//and set is oncontact false from true, and then do a if logic before the switch cases, so there will overlap switchs and contact switches
